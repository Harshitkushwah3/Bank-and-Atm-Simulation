ATM Simulation System
ATM Simulation System is a Java project designed for beginners to understand the basics of personal banking systems. This system allows users to perform various transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and checking the balance of their accounts with just a few clicks. It features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction.

Abstract
This application offers two modes: admin mode and user mode. In admin mode, administrators have control over the entire system, including adding and deleting accounts, as well as updating user records. The user mode allows users to perform transactions like depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking their account balance. The system automates the entire process, from Personal Identification Number (PIN) validation to the transaction itself. Card details are securely stored in the database and can only be accessed by authorized users. The user interface of the application includes a user profile, a list of associated accounts, and options for withdrawal, deposit, and account details update.
